 Sociology is the scientific study of social behaviors,structures and institutions. Why do societies differ so much across time and around the world? Why are some social problems so persistent? Why do individ-uals with similar skills and talents have such different opportunities in life? Many disciplines ask these questions, but sociology answers them with scientific methods and sophisti-cated theories, all with a focus on social change and improving public policy.As we look for answers, we teach our students the skills necessary to become independent thinkers and leaders in the global and urban 21st century.
