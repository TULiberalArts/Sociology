  Sociology is the scientific study of social behaviors, structures and
  institutions. Why do societies differ so much across time and around the
  world? Why are some social problems so persistent? Why do individuals with
  similar skills and talents have such different opportunities in life? Many
  disciplines ask these questions, but sociology answers them with scientific
  methods and sophisticated theories, all with a focus on social change and
  improving public policy.

**_We are saddened by the passing of our beloved professor, [David Allen](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/about-us/newsroom/memoriam-david-allen).  He passed away June 8, 2017.  He will be greatly missed by his students, colleagues, and friends at Temple University._**

Temple sociology offers you the chance to acquire the skills you need to navigate these challenging times. We seek undergraduates willing to be rigorously trained in theories and methods of social analysis, to be equipped for success in fields like business, education, law, community organizing, and for those who enroll in our sociology of health track, a wide range of health professions. We also seek highly motivated students for our master's and doctoral programs.
