Sociology is the scientific study of social behaviors,structures and institutions. Why do societies differ so much across time and around the world? Why are some social problems so persistent? Why do individ-uals with similar skills and talents have such different opportunities in life? Many disciplines ask these questions, but sociology answers them with scientific methods and sophisti-cated theories, all with a focus on social change and improving public policy.As we look for answers, we teach our students the skills necessary to become independent thinkers and leaders in the global and urban 21st century.

## Why Major in Sociology?

The sociology major prepares students for many careers and graduate programs by providing them with a broad sociological perspective and specific research, statistical, and analytical skills. Sociology students study human group interaction, institutions, and societal values and norms through courses in contemporary social issues, social movements, family, urban life, health and health care, organizations, political life, law, race, class, and gender. The sociological perspective develops student awareness of the views and experiences of others and the relationship of individuals and groups to each other, to institutions and organizations, and to the larger society.

Along withs the sociological perspective, sociology majors acquire research, critical thinking, and analytic skills highly valued by both graduate schools and employers. Through research methods courses, research-intensive substantive courses, and specially designed internships, students gain experience in fieldwork; interviewing; developing, administering and analyzing surveys; statistical analysis; and writing research reports.
