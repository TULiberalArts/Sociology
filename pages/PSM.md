The [Professional Science Master’s in Applied Sociology](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/applied-sociology-psm/) provides advanced training in social research methods, including research design, research ethics, and both quantitative and qualitative research.

Our program is designed as a methods-focused master’s degree. There are no required courses in theory or topical fields, although those topics may be taken as electives. Students may take methods and career-oriented courses around the university, although the required classes are housed in sociology.

The PSM is an ideal program for professionals working in government, education, health, criminal justice, and nonprofit or organizational leadership.
