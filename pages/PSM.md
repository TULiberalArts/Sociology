Our [Professional Science Master’s in Applied Sociology](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/applied-sociology-psm/) is ideal program for professionals working in government, education, health, criminal justice, and nonprofit or organizational leadership.

A PSM in Applied Sociology provides advanced training in social research methods, including research design, research ethics, and both quantitative and qualitative research.

Our program is designed as a methods-focused master’s degree. There are no required courses in theory or topical fields, although those topics may be taken as electives. Students may take methods and career-oriented courses around the university, although the required classes are housed in sociology.
