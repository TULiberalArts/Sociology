MA in Sociology with a Certificate in GIS
The Geography & Urban Studies offers a 4-course certificate in Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Sociology MA students who wish to enroll in the GIS certificate should notify the graduate chair of their interest in the certificate as early as possible. GIS is an important research method and the certificate can increase competitiveness on the job market. 2 of the four courses can count as electives towards the MA. In this case, the MA student cannot take any additional courses from outside the department, except by special petition. More information about the certificate is available at [http://www.cla.temple.edu/gus/graduate/graduate-certificate-in-gis/](http://www.cla.temple.edu/gus/graduate/graduate-certificate-in-gis/). 
 
Independent Study courses
 
With the consent of the Graduate Chair and the instructor, MA students may take one Independent Study course, which is an intensive program of study within a specific area of sociology.
 
Students who wish to take Independent Study courses must submit to the Graduate Chair at the beginning of the semester a Department Independent Study Request Form describing the readings and/or research they propose to undertake. This form must be signed by both the participating faculty member and the Graduate Chair. A final statement on the work completed must be filed with the Graduate Chair at the end of the semester. Letter grades are given for these courses.

Pre-Candidacy Evaluation
 
The Department will evaluate doctoral students at the end of their second year using the Grade Point Average (GPA) as a main criterion for advancement to doctoral-level course work. A student with a GPA below 3.4 will ordinarily not be allowed to continue in the doctoral program. However, the student can petition the Graduate Committee for re-consideration. After a petition is submitted, the Graduate Chair will require a written evaluation from each faculty member in the department with whom the student has taken a course. The student will be permitted to continue in the Ph.D. Program if at least five faculty members write in support of the petition. Those not allowed to continue can graduate with an MA upon completion of the requirements.
 
Preliminary Examination
 
After completing the required coursework, doctoral students are expected to take a preliminary examination in the spring semester of their third year. The preliminary examination consists of two parts: the written area examination and the proposal paper.
 
No later than the second Monday in September prior to the spring semester when the prelims will be taken, students must fill out the Department Preliminary Examination Application Form and indicate the selected prelim area as well as the anticipated topic of the proposal paper.
 
(1) The Written Area Exam:
 
The Department has identified five broad examination areas that are consistent with its mission and self-defined areas of strength: Race & Ethnicity, Gender & Sexuality, Urban Sociology, MEdical Sociology, and Globalization & Immigration. However, students may request to take the exam in another area under the following conditions: (1) the student has taken at least two graduate level courses in the sociology department in the requested area, one of which may be an independent study course, (2) two faculty members are willing to sponsor the exam, and (3) approval by the Graduate Chair.
 
Coursework Requirement
 
Prior to taking the preliminary examination, students must complete two or more graduate level courses related to that examination area offered by the faculty within the department. The following is a list of prelim-related courses:
  
Race & Ethnicity

Examination Procedures
 
Once doctoral students complete the required course work, they must take the preliminary examination in one of the three designated areas: Race & Ethnicity, Gender & Sexuality or Urban & Globalization. Required courses include at least two in the selected prelim area taught in the sociology department.
 
At the beginning of the fall semester, two faculty members from the prelim area will be appointed by the Department Chair to form a Prelim Committee, which consists of a chair and one regular member. The committee members will be charged with the following tasks:
 
(1) Update the integrated prelim reading list for the area
(2) Write four prelim questions
(3) Grade the exams
 
The Department Chair will also appoint a tie breaker to read the exam if the committee does not agree in the evaluation.
 
The written area examination consists of four questions, and students must answer two of those questions. Students will receive the questions on a selected Monday in April, and the answers are due on the following Monday. The selected dates will be announced by the first day of the Fall (previous) semester. The Prelim Committee members have one week to evaluate the exam, assigning a grade of Pass or Fail to each question along with their comments. A total of at least three Passes from the two graders is needed for a student to pass the exam. When the graders both agree to fail a question (even if they pass the other question), the student has failed the preliminary exam. The tie-breaker should be used either when: (a) one grader passes both answers and the other grader fails both answers; or (b) when one grader passes the first answer and fails the second, while the other grader fails the first answer and passes the second. In the event that a tie-breaker must be consulted an additional week will be taken to arrive at the final grade. If the tie-breaker fails to break the tie (i.e., three fails and three passes), the student fails the exam. Grades with comments shall be submitted to the Graduate Chair. Grades and comments will be returned to students by the Monday that is two weeks after the exam is submitted.
 
(2) The Proposal Paper:
 
In the spring semester of the preliminary examination, students are also required to take a three-semester hour Proposal Seminar course (9994). They must receive a passing grade on the written paper for the course in order to pass the preliminary examination.
 
The research proposal paper will be the main assignment of the proposal seminar. Every student should select a faculty member with expertise in his/her research area to serve as a proposal reader. The proposal paper reader will meet with the student at least twice during the semester to discuss the paper: once before the spring break and once after the spring break. At the end of each meeting, the reader will provide the student and the instructor of the Proposal Seminar course with a brief narrative of the strengths and weaknesses of the paper. The instructor may meet with the reader to discuss the student’s progress in the writing of the proposal paper. The week after spring break, the instructor will submit a report to the Graduate Chair with a brief description of the performance of each student. Any student who is underperforming will be called to a meeting with the Graduate Chair in the presence of the instructor and the proposal reader to take corrective measures.
 
On the official last day of classes, students submit their proposal paper to the instructor and the reader. The paper should demonstrate mastery of the existing body of literature on the proposed topic and the ability to formulate important scholarly research problems, as well as the appropriate methods to investigate them. The evaluation of the proposal paper will focus on the student’s potential for writing a passable dissertation. Evidence of such potential includes the ability to synthesize the relevant literature, to conceptualize a researchable problem, and to propose a feasible research design. The instructor and the reader have a week to grade the papers and each must submit a detailed, descriptive evaluation of the paper to the Graduate Chair, indicating whether it is acceptable or unacceptable. If the instructor and the reader disagree on the evaluation of the paper, a third department member with expertise in the area will be appointed by the Graduate Chair to provide a determining evaluation. The main goal of the paper evaluation is to assess the student’s ability to write a dissertation.
 
Overall Preliminary Examination Grade:
 
Based on the written area exam grade and the evaluation of the research proposal paper, the Graduate Chair assigns an overall pass or fail to each student for the preliminary examination. Students will be notified of their prelim results at the end of the semester. Students need a pass on the written exam and an acceptable evaluation on the proposal paper to successfully complete the Preliminary Examination. Those who do well on one part but fail the other may retake the part they have failed. Those who fail both the area exam and the proposal paper will be allowed to retake both parts.
 
Retaking the Preliminary Examination:
 
Retaking of the Preliminary Examination will take place the following semester:
 
Written area examination: at the beginning of the fall semester following a failing performance on the exam, three faculty members (including a tie-breaker) in the prelim area will be appointed by the Department Chair to form a Prelim Committee. The committee will submit four questions to the Graduate Chair by October 15. Students are given one week to complete the preliminary exam. The student will receive the questions on a selected Monday in November and the answers are due on the following Monday. The selected dates will be announced by the first day of the Fall semester. The Prelim Committee members have one week to evaluate the exam, assigning a grade of Pass or Fail to each question along with their comments. A total of at least three Passes from the two graders is needed for a student to pass the exam. When the graders both agree to fail a question (even if they pass the other question), the student has failed the preliminary exam. The tie-breaker should be used either when: (a) one grader passes both answers and the other grader fails both answers; or (b) when one grader passes the first answer and fails the second, while the other grader fails the first answer and passes the second. In the event that a tie-breaker must be consulted an additional week will be taken to arrive at the final grade. If the tie-breaker fails to break the tie (i.e., three fails and three passes), the student fails the exam. Grades with comments shall be submitted to the Graduate Chair. Grades and comments will be returned to students by the Monday that is two weeks after the exam is submitted.
 
Proposal paper: if a student is required to re-write the proposal paper, the Graduate Chair will appoint a faculty mentor with expertise in the research topic to work with the student on the re-writing of the paper; the mentor will also serve as a grader. In addition, the Graduate Chair will appoint another faculty member to serve as a second grader. If there is a tie between the two graders, the Graduate Chair will find a third grader to break the tie.
 
The paper is due the first Monday in December. The appointed faculty members will evaluate the paper and report to the Graduate Chair in two weeks whether the paper is acceptable or unacceptable. Students will be notified of the results by December 15. Students who fail on their second attempt at either the written area exam or the proposal paper, will not be allowed to continue in the Ph.D. program but are eligible to receive a master’s degree.
 
Doctoral Advisory Committee
 
Following the preliminary examination, the student will select the chairperson of his/her Doctoral Advisory Committee. The remaining two or more members of the committee will be selected by the student in consultation with his/her chairperson. The majority of the committee members must be from the Department of Sociology. Other members may include faculty from other departments within Temple University or from other universities, and doctoral level expert advisors from outside university settings may also be considered as members.
 
To establish the Doctoral Advisory Committee, the student must submit a Doctoral Advisory Committee Form to the Department’s Graduate Coordinator. To include committee members who are not members of the Temple Graduate Faculty on a Doctoral Advisory Committee, the Chair of the committee must request approval by submitting the Nomination for Service on Doctoral Committee Form and the proposed committee member’s current curriculum vitae to the Dean of the Graduate School. If a change is made in the composition of the Doctoral Advisory Committee, the change must be approved by the Chair of the committee; if the change involves the Chair of the committee, the Graduate Chair should be informed beforehand and the original Chair of the committee must be notified. The change must also be noted on the original Department Doctoral Advisory Committee Form and signed by both the committee Chair and the Graduate Chair.
 
Dissertation Proposal
 
The dissertation proposal is a brief statement of the dissertation research. It should contain a review of the literature, a statement of the research problem, and a comprehensive description of the research strategy to be employed.
 
The student will distribute a summary (five pages or less) of his/her proposal to all faculty members of the department at least two weeks prior to the oral defense of the proposal. One complete copy of the proposal will also be available in the office of the Graduate Coordinator. All department faculty and graduate students will be invited to attend the presentation of the dissertation proposal.
 
Normally, proposal defenses will be held during the academic year. All members of the committee must be present at the proposal defense, but an alternate member may be requested with prior approval from the Graduate Chair.
 
The dissertation proposal will be accepted only when members of the dissertation committee vote unanimously to accept it. An approved dissertation proposal along with the Dissertation Proposal Transmittal Form must be filed with the Graduate School. After defending the dissertation proposal, a student is formally advanced to Ph.D. Candidacy.
 
If a change is made in the composition of the Doctoral Advisory Committee after the approval of the proposal, the change must be approved by the Chair of the committee and the Dean of the College. The change must be noted on the Request for Change in Dissertation Committee Form and filed with the Graduate School prior to posting the final dissertation defense.
 
Dissertation Defense (Ph.D. Final Examination)
 
One copy of the dissertation will be available in the office of the department at least two weeks before the dissertation defense. An abstract of the dissertation, not exceeding ten pages, must be given to all faculty members ten days before the defense.
 
The dissertation defense will consist of the oral defense of the thesis. Any discrepancy between the final version of the dissertation and the dissertation proposal should be explained and defended.
 
The Doctoral Dissertation Examining Committee will be formed to evaluate the quality of the dissertation and conduct the oral defense (see the Announcement of Oral Defense Form). The committee includes the Doctoral Advisory Committee and at least one outside examiner. If the outside examiner is not a member of the Temple Graduate Faculty, the Chair of the Doctoral Advisory Committee must request approval by submitting the Nomination for Service on Doctoral Committee Form and the outside examiner’s current curriculum vitae to the Dean of the Graduate School at least four weeks in advance of the scheduled defense. Approval must be received prior to posting the oral defense. The Chair of the Dissertation Examining Committee must be a member of the Graduate Faculty but may not be the Chair of the candidate’s Doctoral Advisory Committee. This person, responsible for coordinating and conducting the defense, must be identified when the defense is posted with the Graduate School.
 
All dissertation oral defense examinations will be publicly announced by the Department in writing at least ten days in advance of the examination. The written announcement must be sent to all members of the Doctoral Dissertation Examining Committee, all graduate faculty in the candidate's department, the Dean of the Graduate School and posted in the college. All dissertation examinations are open to the entire academic community.
 
Normally, the dissertation defense will be held during the regular academic year. A dissertation defense passed after the Graduate School deadline in the spring will not qualify the student for a May degree. A summer defense may be scheduled only if all members of the committee agree. The entire dissertation committee must attend the defense. If one or more committee members fail to attend the defense, the Departmental Chair will not sign the form certifying the defense. All faculty members and students are invited to participate in the dissertation defense.
 
The dissertation committee must vote unanimously that the student has passed the Ph.D. Final Examination. Each member of the dissertation committee indicates his/her assessment of the examination and signs his/her name to the Final Examination Report for Doctoral Candidates. If the Chairperson of the Sociology Department agrees that the dissertation meets departmental standards, he or she will signify his or her approval by signing for the department.
 
An electronic copy must be filed with the Graduate School. Information regarding the required format of the dissertation (i.e., paper, form and style, etc.) is available either from at http://www.temple.edu/dissertationhandbook/. As part of filing an electronic dissertation, the microfilming fee, and copyright fee (if copyrighting) must be paid online through the e-dissertation site at http://dissertations.umi.com/temple. This site delineates formatting, deadlines, and how to upload your dissertation.
 
Students must apply to graduate, through the Department, by the announced deadline date. These dates are given in the graduate catalog each year. They are usually three or four months before graduation. Applications may be obtained from the Department’s Graduate Coordinator or online.
