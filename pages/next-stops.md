A sociology degree will prepare you for many careers and graduate programs by providing you with a broad sociological perspective and specific research, statistical and analytical skills. 

Sociology students study human group interaction, institutions, and societal values and norms through courses in contemporary social issues, social movements, family, urban life, health and health care, organizations, political life, law, race, class, and gender.

Through research-intensive coursework and specially-designed internships, students gain experience in fieldwork, interviewing, analyzing surveys, statistical analysis, and writing research reports.

We also help connect students with internship and job opportunities, as well as placement in prestigious master’s and PhD programs.
