Our bachelorâ€™s program teaches students about the study of human behavior in the context of the groups, organizations, institutions and societies in which it occurs. We offer courses covering a wide range of topics, including: race and racism, sexuality and gender, health and health care, education, urban life, housing, organizations, family, political life, popular culture, immigration, international development and globalization.

A BA in sociology prepares students for many careers and graduate programs and provides a broad sociological perspective and specific research, statistical and analytic skills.

Students who are interested in a career in the health field can pursue a special sociology major focused on health-related coursework.
